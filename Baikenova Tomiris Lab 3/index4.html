            <h1> How did people communicate in Ancient time?</h1>
            <p>Ancient times Making sounds like grunting or guttural noises at a low or high pitch might either signify social communication or be a warning indicator. At this period, communication also included body language. Humans later discovered the
                necessity to record their everyday actions, which led to the development of written communication. For example, cave drawings. People created paintings called cave drawings to depict their civilization on the cave and canyon walls. They
                would share tales of conflicts, hunts, and cultural events. Pictograms, which are variants of cave drawings, allowed prehistoric man to communicate in a more complicated way. Pictograms are pictures that depict a straightforward location
                or item. Ideograms were developed later and used to convey ideas.
